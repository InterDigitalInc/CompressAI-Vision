compressai-vision-plot [options] command 

commands:

    manual              shows this manual

    csv                 dump json results in csv format

    plot                create the plot

parameters for plot:
 
    --dirs              list of directories with json files produced
    --symbols           list of matplotlib symbols for each plot, 
                        for example: o--k,-g,*:r
    --names             list of names to be included into the plot, 
                        for example: vtm,mymodel,mymodel2
    --eval              mAP value without (de)compress and maplotlib symbol,
                        for example: 0.792,--c
    --show-baseline     include VTM baseline results into the plot at
                        a certain scale (100,75,50 or 25)


instructions:

    The compressai-vision command has produced you json output files
    to a certain directory (say, into "model1_results/")

    In a single json file you can have multiple (bpp, mAP) results (for
    each quality parameter)

    You can also have several json files, each containing just one or more
    (bpp, mAP) results (say, if you have parallelized compressai-vision run
    over quality parameters)

    This script handles both situations automatically, you just need to
    provide the directory name(s)

    Suppose you want to plot two (bpp, mAP) curves from two models 
    (results are in "model1_results" and "model2_results") and also include
    the VTM baseline, then do this:

    compressai-vision-plot --dirs=model1_results,model2_results \\
    --symbols=o--r,x-b --names=model1,model2 \\
    --eval=0.792,--c --show-baseline=100
