CompressAI-Vision helps you to develop, test and evaluate compression models with standardized tests in the context of compression methods optimized for machine tasks algorithms such as Neural-Network (NN)-based detectors.

It currently focuses on two types of pipeline:

- Video compression for remote inference (`compressai-remote-inference`), which corresponds to the MPEG "Video Coding for Machines" (VCM) activity.

- Split inference (`compressai-split-inference`), which  includes an evaluation framework for compressing intermediate features produced in the context of split models. The software supports all thepipelines considered in the related MPEG  activity: "Feature Compression for Machines" (FCM).

## Features

- [Detectron2](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is used for object detection (Faster-RCNN) and instance segmentation (Mask-RCNN)

- [JDE](https://github.com/Zhongdao/Towards-Realtime-MOT) is used for Object Tracking

## Documentation

A complete documentation is provided [here](https://interdigitalinc.github.io/CompressAI-Vision/index.html), including [installation](https://interdigitalinc.github.io/CompressAI-Vision/installation), [CLI usage](https://interdigitalinc.github.io/CompressAI-Vision/cli_usage.html), as well as [tutorials](https://interdigitalinc.github.io/CompressAI-Vision/tutorials).

## installation

To get started locally and install the development version of CompressAI-Vision, first create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/venv.html) with python==3.8:

```
python3.8 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
```

The CompressAI library providing learned compresion modules is available as a submodule. It can be initilized by running:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

To install the models relevant for the FCM (feature compression):

First, if you want to manually export CUDA related paths, please source (e.g. for CUDA 11.8):
```
bash scripts/env_cuda.sh 11.8
```
Then, run:, please run:
```
bash scripts/install.sh
```

For more otions, check:
```
bash scripts/install.sh --help
```

NOTE 1: install.sh gives you the possibility to install vision models' source and weights at specified locations so that mutliple versions of compressai-vision can point to the same installed vision models

NOTE 2: the downlading of JDE pretrained weights might fail. Check that the size of following file is ~558MB.
path/to/weights/jde/jde.1088x608.uncertainty.pt
The file can be downloaded at the following link (in place of the above file path):

## Usage

### Split inference pipelines

To run split-inference pipelines, please use the following command:
```
compressai-split-inference --help
```

Note that the following entry point is kept for backward compability. It runs split inference as well. 
```
compressai-vision-eval --help
```


For example for testing a full split inference pipelines without any compression, run

```
compressai-vision-eval --config-name=eval_split_inference_example
```

### Remote inference pipelines

For remote inference (MPEG VCM-like) pipelines, please run:
```
compressai-remote-inference --help
```

### Configurations

Please check other configuration examples provided in ./cfgs as well as examplary scripts in ./scripts

Test data related to the MPEG FCM activity can be found in ./data/mpeg-fcm/

## For developers

After your dev, you can run (and adapt) test scripts from the scripts/tests directory. Please check scripts/tests/Readme.md for more details

### Contributing

Code is formatted using black and isort. To format code, type:
```
make code-format
```
Static checks with those same code formatters can be run manually with:
```
make static-analysis
```

### Compiling documentation

To produce the html documentation, from [docs/](docs/), run:
```
make html
```
To check the pages locally, open [docs/_build/html/index.html](docs/index.html)
